You can use inline footnotes to hide information from the reader unless they
click on the little footnote superscript indicator. They look like this.
<label for="2025-10-30-fn-1">*</label>
<input id="2025-10-30-fn-1" type="checkbox"></input>
<small>Now you can read this information. Click the indicator again to hide it.</small>
</p>

<p>
You can use footnotes to stow away extra text, or any arbitrary HTML you want
to throw in there as well.

<h3>A Note About External Links</h3>

<p>
If you include links to external sites in your website, then <em>totem</em> will
expect you to "mark" them as external. What you should do is the following:
</p>

<code>&lt;a href="https://example.com"&gt;Link Text&lt;/a&gt;</code>

<p>
Should become:
</p>

<code>&lt;a { EXT_LINK } href="https://example.com"&gt;Link Text&lt;/a&gt;</code>

<p>
Except, you don't want those spaces between the curly braces ({,}) and the EXT_LINK.
I'm just doing that here otherwise it will get replaced when I render this post.
</p>

<p>
During the build process, that marker will be replaced with
<code class="inline">target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"</code>
which guarantees that the link will open in a new tab instead of the current one.
</p>

<p>
You can test it out by following <a {EXT_LINK} href="https://example.com">this link</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> If you forget to include the EXT_LINK marker, <em>totem</em> will
complain about that specific link during the build process, so you can go find
it and add the EXT_LINK marker.
</p>
