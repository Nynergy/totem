<b><em>Locus Temporarius</em></b> is an example website built with <em>totem</em>.
</p>

<h3>Things To Do Here</h3>

<p>
Click on links. Follow them. Explore the site.
</p>

<p>
If you want to know why something is styled the way it is, take a look at the
file <code class="inline">_style/style.css</code> and make changes if desired.
</p>

<p>
Pay special attention to the following CSS:
</p>

<code>section,
section:target ~ #home,
#home:has(~ section:target) {
    display: none;
}

#home, section:target {
    display: block;
}
</code>

<p>
This is what allows the site to show/hide pages based on what the user has
selected. Removing it may lead to unintended site behavior.
