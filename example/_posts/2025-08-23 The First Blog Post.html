<h3>A Note About Filenames</h3>

<p>
<em>totem</em> expects the blog post filenames to be in a specific format. It
uses this format to determine what the associated title and date of the post is.
The format is as follows:
</p>

<code>YYYY-MM-DD Arbitrary Post Title.html</code>

<p>
In plain English, the filename must start with a date in YYY-MM-DD format, such
as 2024-06-12, then contain a space, then you can use whatever title you want.
